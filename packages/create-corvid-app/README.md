# Create Corvid App

`create-corvid-app` sets up a local site project to use `corvid-cli` and clones your [Wix](https://www.wix.com) site in a single command.

## Prerequisites
[Node.JS](https://nodejs.org) version >= 10 

## Usage

Just run:

```
npx create-corvid-app <folder-name> [your-wix-site-url]
```

Sit back and relax while we initialize the specified folder with the recommended setup for working with `corvid-cli`.
If you provide a Wix site URL (optional), we will also clone your site into that folder.
